There's one more aspect to be addressed, and that is how to make the input arguments order-agnostic (to avoid sorting input arguments). To make the hand_rank order-agnostic, the card rank of each input can be mapped to prime numbers, and the product of these prime numbers are (1) unique (the product of unique primes is unique) and (2) order-agnostic (due to the multiplication commutative property). This mapped relationship can be implemented in various ways, for example via lookup tables, binary search etc.","category":"page"},{"location":"#PokerHandEvaluator.jl's-implementation","page":"Home","title":"PokerHandEvaluator.jl's implementation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"PokerHandEvaluator.jl uses PlayingCards.jl and defines hand_rank for a Tuple of 5 Cards.
